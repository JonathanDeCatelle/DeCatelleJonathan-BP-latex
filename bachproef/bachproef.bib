We spreken dan van een Native app. Een responsive webapp benader je op een andere manier, namelijk via je browser, bijvoorbeeld Chrome, Edge, Firefox of Safari. Een webapp mag daarom niet écht een app worden genoemd. Je hoeft namelijk niets te installeren op je telefoon, de webapp is via een URL bereikbaar. Dus ook vanaf een desktop. Een hybride app is een combinatie van deze twee. Maar wat gebruik je nou wanneer en waarom? In dit blog bespreken we de voor- en nadelen van native apps, webapps en hybride apps.},

Mobile app development is constantly evolving, with new technologies and frameworks emerging every year. With various solutions on the market, it's often difficult to choose between them. You might have heard about the long-standing "native versus cross-platform" debate.

There are many factors to consider before building an app, such as development cost, time, and app functionality. This is especially true if you want to target both Android and iOS audiences. It may be challenging to decide which mobile development approach will be the best for your particular project. To help you choose between native and cross-platform app development, we've created a list of six essential things to keep in mind.},

  abstract    = {Over the last decade, there has been a significant increase in the development of mobile applications. The performance of the developed applications depends largely on the development approaches. There are two widely used approaches: (1) native, where the application is targeted and developed for a specific platform, (2) cross-platform, where the developed application runs on multiple platforms. This paper aims to address the question of which approach should be used in various scenarios. We have performed a detailed comparison of the two approaches by developing a mobile app using both approaches. Experiments are performed using Android and iOS, the two most well-known mobile Operating System. The criteria of deciding the best approach include performance, usability and support. Our results show that both approaches are viable depending on the requirements and type of the application to be developed, with native having an edge. Guidelines are presented at the end to help the developers in choosing the best approach. The fundamental differences and advantages of each approach are discussed.},
